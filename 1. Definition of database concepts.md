1. **What is a Database and How is Data Stored?**

**Definition of a Database**

A database is an organized collection of data that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. It is structured in such a way that data can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

**Types of Databases**

Databases can be categorized into different types:

**Relational Databases (RDBMS)** – Stores data in tables with relationships between them (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server).

**NoSQL Databases** – Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase).

**Hierarchical Databases** – Data is stored in a tree-like structure (e.g., IBM Information Management System).

**Network Databases** – Uses a graph structure instead of tables (e.g., IDMS, Neo4j).

**How Data is Stored in a Relational Database?**

T**ables**: Data is stored in tables (similar to spreadsheets), where each table represents an entity.

**Rows (Records)**: Each row represents a single record (e.g., a customer or an order).

**Columns (Fields)**: Each column represents an attribute of the entity (e.g., customer name, email, phone number).

**Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row.

**Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table to create relationships.
