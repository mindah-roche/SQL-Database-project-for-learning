**Introduction to Relational Database Concepts (Tables, Rows, Columns)***

**Relational Database Structure**

**Entity:** A real-world object stored as a table.

**Attributes:** Characteristics of an entity (columns in a table).

**Relationships:** Connections between tables using primary and foreign keys.

**Example of a Simple Table: Customers**

customer_id  name        email               phone
1            John Doe    john@example.com    1234567890 
2            Jane Smith  jane@example.com     9876543210

Each row is a record, and each column represents an attribute.
