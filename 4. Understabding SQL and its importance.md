**Why is SQL Important?**

**Data Management**: Allows efficient data storage, retrieval, and updating.

**Scalability**: Used by enterprises for managing large datasets.

**Data Integrity**: Supports constraints and relationships to maintain accuracy.

**Security**: Provides authentication and access control mechanisms.

**Basic SQL Operations**

**DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Used for defining database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).

**DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Used for modifying data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

**DQL (Data Query Language)**: Used for retrieving data (e.g., SELECT).

**DCL (Data Control Language)**: Used for access control (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
